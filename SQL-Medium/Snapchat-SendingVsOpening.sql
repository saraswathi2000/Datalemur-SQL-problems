/*
Challenge : Snapchat(sending vs opening snaps)
Difficulty level : Medium
Assume you are given the tables below containing information on Snapchat users, their ages, and their time spent sending and opening snaps. Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps (as a percentage of total time spent on these activities) for each age group.

Output the age bucket and percentage of sending and opening snaps. Round the percentage to 2 decimal places.

Notes:

You should calculate these percentages:
time sending / (time sending + time opening)
time opening / (time sending + time opening)
To avoid integer division in percentages, multiply by 100.0 and not 100.
